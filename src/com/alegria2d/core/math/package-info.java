/**
 * This package includes all Alegria mathematical classes.
 * <p>
 * Note for contributors:
 * <p>
 * Some codes in this package may not follow the Java code conventions strictly. This package is an exception since
 * there are also strong mathematical conventions, and sometimes they are preferred. An example of this is the
 * {@link Matrix3D} class where some variables are declared uppercase, since matrices are represented in math as a
 * uppercase letter.
