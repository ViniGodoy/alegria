========== Introduction ==========

The aim of this project is to create a hardware accelerated 2D game engine.

========== Details ==========

Alegria will support powerful features such as:

    Dynamic lighting and blending;
    Shaders;
    Camera positioning and zoom;
    Multi-layering and parallax scrolling;
    Tile maps and isometric tiles;
    Particles generation;
    Scripting;
    5.1 sound;
    Several game input systems; 

See more in our brainstorm list.

Alegria is divided into three main layers:

    Base: That will contain low-level classes that manage input, network and graphics abstracting platform specific details;
    Game: That will contain game objects, tile maps, physics, AI and other game related stuff;
    Editors: Which will help users to create their game and configure all Alegria components to work together; 

========== Dependencies ==========

Alegria is built on top of LWJGL 2.6 and Java 6. This API uses Slick-Utils.jar.
